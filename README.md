# paella-video-plugins

Adds paella-core support for other video formats, and provides utilities related to these formats.

##Â Usage

**Step 1:** Import the plugin context and add it to the Paella Player initialization parameters:

Usin plugin context API:


```javascript
...
import {
    webglPlugins, // All plugins
} from 'paella-webgl-plugins';

let paella = new Paella('player-container', {
    plugins: [
        ...webglPlugins
    ]
});
...
```

You can also use the generic plugin array name to import all the plugins:

```js
import { allPlugins as webglPlugins } from 'paella-webgl-plugins'
...
```

All the plugin libraries exports the `allPlugins` array. This is done in order to have a method to import all plugins using always the same name for all libraries.

**Step 2:** Configure the plugins you want to use in the paella player configuration.

```json
{
    "plugins": {
        ...
       "es.upv.paella.hlsVideoFormat": {
            "enabled": true,
            "order": 0,
            ...
        },
        ... other plugin settings
    }
}
```

## HLS Video Plugin

Adds compatibility to playback HLS m3u8 streams. This plugin uses the library hls.js to playback m3u8 streams in browsers that supports Media Source Extensions, including those that can play m3u8 streams nativelly. The only exception is those browsers that can play m3u8 and are not compatible with Media Source Extensions, such as the iPhone browsers.

### Configuration

To tune up the configuration of the player, you may check the hls.js configuration options. You can set these options using the plugin configuration in config.json file, with the hlsConfig attribute.

The configuration callbacks cannot be specified, but in practice the only callback we may need to configure is xhrSetup, in case we want to modify the options in the Ajax request to get the stream chunks. To solve this, the corsConfig attribute allows to modify these parameters. If corsConfig.withCredentials is true, then the headers defined in requestHeaders will be added. The HLS plugin includes a mechanism that prevents the browser to use cache in the main m3u8 playlist file. This mechanism works by adding a cache=random_number parameter to the URL of the m3u8 file request. You can use the disableCache parameter to disable this mechanism.

(paella-core >= 1.20) In iPadOS and macOS, using Safari, if the forceNative attribute is set to true, this plugin will bypass hls.js in favor of the native HLS player provided by the browser. Please note that on iPadOS and iOS, due to limitations imposed by Apple in the app store, all third-party browsers are required to use the WebKit framework for web rendering, which in practice makes all third-party browsers on this platform behave the same as Safari. Note that the native HLS plugin in Safari does not support many of the features supported by the HLS version, such as manual selection of playback quality. Apple does not provide any method to do these things natively, so it is recommended to use the hls.js player whenever possible.

```json
"es.upv.paella.hlsVideoFormat": {
  "enabled": true,
  "order": 0,
  "audioTrackLabel": "name",
  "disableCache": false,
  "forceNative": false,
  "hlsConfig": {
    "maxBufferLength": 40
  },
  "corsConfig": {
    "withCredentials": false,
    "requestHeaders": {
      "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": false
    }
  }
}
```

**crossorigin** (paella-core >= 1.28)

By default, the crossorigin attribute of the HTML video is added without content:

```html
...
<video crossorigin >
  ...
</video>
```

If any other value needs to be configured, the crossOrigin configuration parameter can be used:

```json
{
    "plugins": {
        ...
        "es.upv.paella.hlsVideoFormat": {
            "enabled": true,
            "order": 1,
            "crossOrigin": "user-credentials"
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

To prevent the crossorigin attribute from being added to the <video> element, you can set the configuration value to false.:

```json
"es.upv.paella.hlsVideoFormat": {
    "enabled": true,
    "order": 1,
    "crossOrigin": false
}
```

### Video Manifest

```json
{
  ...
  "streams": [
    {
      "sources": {
        "hls": [
          {
              "src": "https://url.to/your/playlist.m3u8",
              "mimetype": "video/mp4",
              "res": {
                "w": "1920",
                "h": "1080"
              }
          }
        ]
      },
      "content": "presenter",
      "role": "mainAudio"
    }
  ]
}
```

The format identifier is hls. The array can contain only one element, if it contains more than one, the rest will be ignored.

- src: Absolute or relative URL to the .m3u8 playlist file.
- mimetype: The mimetype of the original mp4 file. This parameter is currently not used.
- res: The resolution of the highest quality stream in .m3u8 stream. This parameter is currently not used.

### Multiple audio tracks

Paella can play hls files with multiple audio tracks. The easiest way to select which audio track to play is via the es.upv.paella.audioSelector plugin, within the paella-basic-plugins plugin library.

- [Using ffmpeg to generate an HLS with multiple audio tracks](https://paellaplayer.upv.es/#/doc/ffmpeg_multiple_audio_tracks_hls.md)
- [Using wowza and SMIL files to generate an HLS with multiple audio tracks.](https://paellaplayer.upv.es/#/doc/wowza_multiple_audio_tracks_smil.md)

### About audioTrackLabel setting

The paella-core APIs allow selecting the active audio track, as well as displaying information about that track to the user. Tags are included within the m3u8 playlist for this purpose:

```
...
#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="aac",LANGUAGE="es",NAME="Spanish",DEFAULT=YES,AUTOSELECT=YES,URI="chunklist_w777901138_b105768_ao_sles_t64U3BhbmlzaA==.m3u8?cache=96104139164"
#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="aac",LANGUAGE="en",NAME="English",DEFAULT=NO,AUTOSELECT=YES,URI="chunklist_w777901138_b105768_ao_slen_t64RW5nbGlzaA==.m3u8?cache=96104139164"
```

By default, the data with which the audio track is identified is "NAME". However, it is possible to configure which data we want to use to obtain the language label. It is possible to choose between the following labels:

- name: corresponds to the "NAME" field in the m3u8 file.
- lang: corresponds to the "LANGUAGE" field in the m3u8 file.
- groupId: corresponds to the "GROUP-ID" field in the m3u8 file.

To customise this tag we can use the plugin configuration, or the video manifest. The video manifest configuration value will take precedence over the plugin configuration, if both are present.

Video manifest:

```json
{
  ...
  "streams": [
    {
      "sources": {
        "hls": [
          {
            "src": "https://mywowzaserver.com/video/playlist.m3u8",
            "mimetype": "video/mp4",
            "audioLabel": "name" <<== customize audioLabel
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Plugin configuration:

```json
"es.upv.paella.hlsVideoFormat": {
  ...
  "audioTrackLabel": "name",
  ...
}
```

If you have generated an m3u8 playlist following the instructions in the previous section Using ffmpeg to generate an HLS with multiple audio tracks), you may have encountered the problem that FFMPEG ignores the track names specified on the command line. It is possible to edit the playlist file afterwards to modify the track names, but you can also use the audioTrackLabel property to get the track names from another field, such as the language.

```json
"es.upv.paella.hlsVideoFormat": {
  ...
  "enableCache": false,
  ...
}
```

The enableCache attribute allows you to enable the browser cache for downloading m3u8 files. It is usually advisable to enable it, but if the m3u8 playlist files or the streaming server configuration changes frequently, it is usually better to disable it.

```json
"es.upv.paella.hlsVideoFormat": {
  ...
  "forceNative": false,
  ...
}
```

The forceNative attribute is used on iPadOS and macOS platforms, using the Safari browser. These platforms using Safari support HLS natively, but also support the hlsjs-based plugin.

Native playback is better in terms of efficiency and usually gives fewer problems. In addition to this, if native HLS playback fails due to some problem, the problem is almost certainly in the video streaming server configuration or encoding, so it can be used for debugging.

In contrast, the hlsjs library uses the Media Source Extensions to implement HLS playback via JavaScript. This option is less efficient, but much more flexible. For example, with the native mode it is not possible to manually select the streaming quality.

### Troubleshooting

In our experience, 99% of the problems with HLS streams are related to the configuration of the hls.js library and, above all, to the configuration of the streaming server and video codec. Apart from this, the HLS plugin is native for those platforms that do not support Media Source Extensions, but supports HLS nativelly (that is, all browsers in iOS for iPhone and iPod Touch).

## Taking this into account:

If you have problems in iOS browsers: it doesn't matter in which browser you have problems, since due to App Store policies all browsers use the system's rendering engine and video codecs. So in practice all browsers work the same. In this case, your problem is in the video codec or streaming server configuration. Nothing can be changed change in Paella Player to solve this kind of issues, because HLS is managed by the brower itself.
If you have problems in other browsers: check the hls.js documentation to see what features of HLS are supported. Also check the HLS specifications and recommendations for video encoding. Note that not all browsers support all codecs. Some problems may be fixed changing the hls.js configuration.
Please note that, although it is theoretically possible to view live video streams using the hlsVideoFormat plugin, it is very likely to have problems in some browsers. If you have problems with live streams, or especially low latency streams, be sure to use the hlsLiveVideoFormat plugin by replacing the hls tag with hlsLive in the video manifest (see the documentation of hls live video plugin here).
If you have problems playing videos using authentication, set the disableCache parameter to false in the configuration. This mechanism prevents the browser from using the cache with m3u8 files, and does so by adding a random parameter in the URL of the playlist file. This can cause problems with some streaming servers when getting authenticated videos.
If there are lag or freeze issues with videos that have more than one stream, try increasing the maximum desynchronization time of the videos in the video container settings:

```json
{
  "videoContainer": {
    "multiStreamMaxDesyncTime": 0.5,
    ...
  }
}
```

## HLS Live Vide Plugin

It is implemented from hls video plugin. The difference is that this plugin responds to streams labeled hlsLive from video manifest. In addition, the hls live plugin does not support setting the initial video quality, as this setting usually gives problems with low latency videos. In general, most of HLS Live's configuration options are identical to those of HLS Video.

### Video Manifest

The configuration in the video manifest is identical to that of the hls streams, only the label changes to hlsLive:

```json
{
  ...
  "streams": [
    {
      "sources": {
        "hlsLive": [
          {
              "src": "https://url.to/your/playlist.m3u8",
              "mimetype": "video/mp4",
              "res": {
                "w": "1920",
                "h": "1080"
              }
          }
        ]
      },
      "content": "presenter",
      "role": "mainAudio"
    }
  ]
}
```


### Motivation

Separating the m3u8 video streams from the live m3u8 streams allows to have different configurations for both plugins. So, if we want to optimize the live videos for low latency, we can specify that configuration in the hlsLive plugin, as some configuration parameters can be counterproductive with respect to the normal m3u8 video.

**config.json:**

```json
{
    ...
    "es.upv.paella.hlsVideoFormat": {
        "enabled": true,
        "order": 0,
        "enableCache": true,
        "hlsConfig": {

   >>> Set here the configuration for standard HLS video
            "maxBufferLength": 10
        },
        "corsConfig": {
            "withCredentials": false,
            "requestHeaders": {
                "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": false
            }
        }
    },
    "es.upv.paella.hlsLiveVideoFormat": {
        "enabled": true,
        "order": 0,
        "hlsConfig": {
    >>> Set here the configuration for live low latency HLS video

            "enableWorker": true,
            "maxBufferLength": 1,
            "liveBackBufferLength": 0,
            "liveSyncDuration": 0,
            "liveMaxLatencyDuration": 5,
            "liveDurationInfinity": true,
            "highBufferWatchdogPeriod": 1

        },
        "corsConfig": {
            "withCredentials": false,
            "requestHeaders": {
                "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": false
            }
        }
    },
}
```

### HLS low latency

Paella supports HLS Low Latency by using the hls.js libraray. You only need to configure your streaming server to support it. See hls.js low latency support project.

You can check your stream in the [hls.js demo page](https://hls-js.netlify.app/demo/). If the streams works in this demo, it will work on paella.

If you use [wowza streaming server](https://www.wowza.com/), you can follow [this guide to configure HLS Low latency](https://paellaplayer.upv.es/#/doc/wowza_configure_hls_low_latency.md).

## HLS Captions selector plugin

Allows you to select the subtitle track of an HLS stream. This plugin is not integrated with the paella-core subtitle system, but uses the APIs of the hls.js library that allow to display the subtitles of a m3u8 playlist printed over the video containing the subtitles. For that reason, the subtitles will only be seen on the HLS video. Also, the plugin implementation is restricted only to the video containing the audio track.

```json
{
    "es.upv.paella.hlsCaptionsSelectorPlugin": {
        "enabled": true,
        "side": "right",
        "parentContainer": "playbackBar",
        "menuTitle": "Available Captions"
    },
    ...
}
```

**Exported as** `HlsCaptionsSelectorButtonPlugin`.

**Icon customization data:**

- Plugin identifier: `es.upv.paella.hlsCaptionsSelectorPlugin`
- Icon names:
    * `captionsIcon`
